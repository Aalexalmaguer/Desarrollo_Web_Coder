        <p>
            Here’s where the suit comes off and curiosity takes over. I’m into books that shift perspectives, languages that stretch the brain, and sports that keep the mind sharp and body moving.

        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>
            I'm driven by the future of finance, from blockchain and DeFi to machine learning in investment strategy. Whether it's analyzing crypto markets, or exploring the next big fintech wave, this is the world that keeps me inspired and always learning.

        <h2>Sports</h2>
        <p>
            Staying active is a big part of who I am. I practice calisthenics and go to the gym regularly to stay strong and focused. On weekends, I enjoy mountain biking and hiking, both of which help me recharge, challenge myself, and maintain a healthy balance between mind and body.

        <h2>Books</h2>
        <p>Books are my escape and my guide. I love reading about finance, technology, and other things. Some of my favorites include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"Understand the Technology, From the Fall of Megaupload to the Secrets of Artificial Intelligence" by Nate Gentile</li>
            <li>"Thinking Fast and Slow" by Daniel Kahneman</li>
            <li>"Efficiently Inefficient" by Lasse Heje Pedersen</li>
            <li>"1984" by George Orwell</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy exploring the things that keep my mind active and my curiosity growing. I have a year-long streak on the Brilliant app, where I dive into topics like math, logic, and science, and I use NeuroNation to sharpen my cognitive skills. I like experimenting with my Flipper Zero, investing in cryptocurrencies, and staying updated on the latest trends in blockchain. I also relax by playing video games like Fortnite and Marvel Rivals, and watching movies. I'm especially drawn to science fiction, psychological dramas like <em>Gattaca</em>, <em>Meet Joe Black</em>, and <em>No Country for Old Men</em>, and recently I’ve been getting into cosmic horror. I also enjoy going out with my girlfriend and spending time with friends, finding inspiration in both the quiet moments and the fun ones.

        <h2>Inspirations</h2>
        <p>
            I draw inspiration from people who challenge the status quo and think big. Charles Hoskinson’s vision for blockchain technology pushes the boundaries of what’s possible in finance. Kanye West, especially in his creative peak, showed how bold ideas and self-confidence can change culture. And Elon Musk’s relentless drive to innovate reminds me to keep pushing forward, no matter the obstacles.

        <h2>Languages</h2>
        <p>
            I’m a native Spanish speaker and have reached a C1 level in English, which lets me communicate fluently in professional and casual settings. I also learned basic French in high school to broaden my horizons and connect with more people around the world.
